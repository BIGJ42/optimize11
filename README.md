### Optimize11 Debloater

The "Optimize11 Debloater" option in the program runs a script that completely debloats Windows 11 and optimizes it for speed and gaming. Please be aware that this script may be unstable and could cause issues if used incorrectly. We highly recommend creating a restore point before making any changes to your PC.
